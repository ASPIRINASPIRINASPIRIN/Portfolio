        <p>We Live in a Rainbow of Chaos(2022)-Album design</p>
        <p>Mailing art/Album design project which is contributed by KABK students in pandemic.
        <br>Inspired from the mail arts of "Correspondence School", and the quote of Paul Cezzane.
        <br>The album consists of a total of three songs, consisting of vocal and visual pieces involving KABK students.
        <br>In 2020, when the pandemic has just begun, and physical communication with others was blocked, I sent music with different lyrics to each friends so that they could continue their music one by one. Each song's lyrics described a trivial joy or absurdity of daily life, and they continued the lyrics in a way that reflected their personal interpretations.
        <br>As someone who thinks that music has the power to make our lives a little more lively and entertaining, even in the chaotic world that we are experiencing for the first time in our lives, I planned this work with the intention of not overlooking the tiny and insignificant pleasures in our daily lives.
        <br>The lyrics for each song were reconstructed into lyric collections (or posters) consisting of visual pieces in which the participants expressed the lyrics themselves.
        <br>"We live in a rainbow of chaos." - Paul Cezzane
