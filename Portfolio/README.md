# CSS Selector Challenge

### Description
Get all the CSS selectors right! Apply the right CSS selectors on the right lines asked below. It starts simple and will grow in complexity and specificity. People that get their selectors right get to select reward!

We will start together each CSS selector category. Starting with me telling the basic rule of the selector category and after which you'll get 5 minutes to apply the selectors.

CSS selectors are patterns used to select element(s) and are both used in CSS for styling as in JavaScript for selecting an HTML element so it can be used, manipulated or added a functionality. They are the key in turning your dull HTML page into fancy website.
